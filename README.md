# Game Of Life
<b>V.1.0.0</b>

A 3D Conways Game of Life for the L3D Cube by <a href="https://github.com/lapentab">lapentab</a>. This code uses findings and notation from this paper http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/01-3-1.pdf. Rule values and cube dimensions can be easily set. The game will reset upon reaching a stable endstate, where all cells have been the same for a while, or all cells have died. Currently, this code is unable to detect oscillatory life, and must currently be reset manually if hitting an oscillary state.
